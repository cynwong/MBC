## Description

Portfolio project is created as per guidelines/instruction given for assignment 1. We are tasked to create a Portfolio website with three web pages. Each page must be similar to example image given. The three page mentioned here are namely: 

    * About 
    * Contact 
    * Portfolio gallery


### About Page - index.html
About page contains avator image and a brief description (or rumbling) of the author. 


### Contact Page - contact.html
Contact page showcase a HTML form which will later allow user to contact the site owner for contact. It is just a non-reponsive form for now. 

### Portfolio gallery - portfolio.html
Portfolio page created as a gallery. Hence, this pages only contains images and their labels.  This page is constructed with &lt;figure&gt;, containing &lt;img&gt; for photos, &lt;figcaption&gt; as labels. CSS is mainly used to achive similar look to the example given, especially &lt;figcaption&gt; elments. This page has a little surprise since it is too boring with a list of photos. Try hovering on the images. CSS is so cool!

**Note: The same words from the examples are used here so the label may not be descriptive nor matched with its labelled photo.

Portfolio project is created with only using HTML and pure CSS. This is the template site with three pages. Each page must be similar to example image given. The three page mentioned here are namely:

    * About 
    * Contact 
    * Portfolio gallery
    
Each page has navigation links to all pages. 


<h4>-- About Page - index.html --</h4>
About page contains avator image and a brief description (or rumbling) of the author. 


<h4>-- Contact Page - contact.html --</h4>
Contact page showcase a HTML form which will later allow user to contact the site owner for contact. It is a simple, non-reponsive form for now. 

<h4>-- Portfolio gallery - portfolio.html --</h4>
Portfolio page created as a gallery. Hence, this pages only contains images and their labels.  This page is constructed with &lt;figure&gt;, containing &lt;img&gt; for photos,and &lt;figcaption&gt; as labels. CSS is mainly used to achive similar look to the example given, especially &lt;figcaption&gt; elments. This page has a little surprise since it is too boring with a list of photos. Try hovering on the images. CSS is so cool!

<em>Note: The random captions are used here so the label are not meant to be descriptive nor matched with its photo.</em>

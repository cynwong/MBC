## Description

Portfolio project is created as per guidelines/instruction given for assignment 1. We are tasked to create a Portfolio website with three web pages. Each page must be similar to example image given. The three page mentioned here are namely: 

    * About 
    * Contact 
    * Portfolio gallery


### About Page - index.html
About page contains avator image and bio of the author. 


### Contact Page - contact.html
Contact page showcase a HTML form which will later allow user to contact the site owner for contact. It is just a non-reponsive form for now. 

### Portfolio gallery - portfolio.html
Portfolio page created as a gallery. Hence, this pages only contains images and its label. The same words from the examples are used here so the label may not be descriptive nor matched with its labelled photo. This page is constructed with &lt;img&gt; for photos, &lt;p&gt; as labels and &lt;div&gt; as container. CSS is mainly used to achived similar look to the example given, especially &lt;p&gt; tags. This page has a little surprise. Try hovering on the images. CSS is so cool!

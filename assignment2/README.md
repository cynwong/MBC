This project is the re-creation of previous project using Bootstrap CSS Framework. This also has 3 web pages, namely: 
    1. [About](https://cynwong.github.io/assignments/assignment2/index.html) page
    2. [Portfolio](https://cynwong.github.io/assignments/assignment2/portfolio.html)

In this project, I have used the following items: 
    1. A navbar - Navbar, used in this project, is  not Bootstrap's default Navbar. Bootstrap's navbar is constucted with CSS Flexbox. Being a flexbox, it has very limited in moblie repsonsiveness. Therefore, for the sake of reponsiveness, a new Navbar is built using Bootstrap's Grid system and Navs components. 
    2. A responsive layout - Bootstrap's Grid system is used to ensure reponsiveness of all pages. For example, when viewed in 
    3. Reponsive images - Portfolio images are using Bootstrap's image class, called ".img-fluid", to ensure responsiveness.
